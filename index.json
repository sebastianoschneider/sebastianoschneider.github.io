This approach -- which we call the minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) approach -- uses sample characteristics to obtain balanced treatment groups. Compared to other methods, the min MSE procedure is attrition tolerant, offers greater flexibility, is very fast, it can be conveniently implemented and balances different moments of the distribution of the treatment groups. Additionally, it has a clear theoretical foundation, works without parameter being specified by the researcher and allows multiple treatments. The information used for treatment assignment can be multivariate, continuous and may consist of any number of variables. In this paper, we derive the underlying theoretical selection criteria, which we then apply to various simulated treatment effect scenarios and datasets, comparing it to established approaches. Our proposed method performs better than, or comparably to, competing approaches, such as matching, in most of the commonly used measures of balance.

Theoretically, they are also connected with other important behavior, such as health-related or eco-friendly behavior, but these relations have never been investigated with field data. In a large-scale experiment with 658 adolescents, we relate experimental measures of higher order risk preferences with field behavior. Field behavior with respect to six different domains is collected in an extensive survey, where we focus on general risk taking, the environmental and the health domain, particularly on addictive behavior. Using a novel method allowing the experimental elicitation of intensities of prudence and temperance, we find females behaving more risk averse, prudent and temperant, and high-ability students behaving less risk averse and temperant. We replicate findings on financial decision making and higher order risk preferences, and find that prudence is a strong predictor for health-related behavior: An index capturing the addictive use of smartphones is predicted significantly by prudence, but not by risk aversion or temperance. .","tags":null,"title":" (Higher Order) Risk Preferences: Experimental Measures, Determinants and Related Field Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerhard Riener","Sebastian O.

In this paper we present evidence on the selection of partner institutions into participation and balanced treatment assignment in field experiments. We answer two questions: (1) do stakeholders that choose to participate in a field experiment differ from the population of interest, and (2) does pre-treatment balancedness on observable characteristics translate to lower bias and increased power in a real-world setting, and which method should best be used if that is the case? To this end, we conducted a recruitment experiment, inviting stakeholders to participate in field experiments with their institutions and varying the salience of the research topic and the stakes of participation. We combine this experimental data with a rich set of administrative data on institution and municipality characteristics to identify a possible self-selection bias. Moreover, we compare pure randomization, matching, and re-randomization to a new treatment assignment method -- the minimum mean squared error treatment assignment (min MSE) proposed by Schneider and Schlather (2017). We find no evidence for a self-selection bias on observable characteristics and estabhlish that balancedness as achieved by the minMSE method reduces bias of treatment effect estimation by 33% compared to pure randomization. The minMSE method performs best in increasing pre-treatment balancedness of observable characteristics compared to pure randomization, matching, and simple re-randomization.","tags":null,"title":"Self-Selection and Treatment Assignment in Field Experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcela Ibanez","Sebastian O.

Here we present a new experimental method to elicit utility functions and associated measures of (higher order) risk preferences. The method we propose builds on a non-parametric estimation technique called P-spline regression in order to obtain continuous and differentiable estimations of utility functions from any mapping of experimental income to utility levels. Using this method we can compute well-known theoretically derived measures of the intensities of risk aversion, prudence and temperance. We apply this method to study precautionary saving with a sample of poor households in Bogota: Leland (1968) suggests that under risky income prudent individuals increase savings as a precautionary measure. We obtain results comparable to those of earlier studies with respect to the classification of individuals as prudent or imprudent. In addition, our results strongly support the theoretical prediction that income risk leads to increases in savings for prudent individuals. An accompanying laboratory experiment validates our method: We find significant relations to other methods, and are able to replicate our finding with respect to precautionary saving.
