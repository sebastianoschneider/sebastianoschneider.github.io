Using a novel method to elicit and measure these preferences, we show that women are more risk averse, prudent and temperant than men, and high-ability students behave less risk averse and temperant. In line with theoretical predictions, we then find that higher order risk preferences - particularly prudence - are strongly related to adolescents' financial decision making, environmentally-friendly behavior, and health status, including addictive behavior. Dropping higher order risk preferences from the analysis would yield largely misleading conclusions about the relation of risk aversion to field behavior.","tags":null,"title":"Higher Order Risk Preferences: New Experimental Measures, Determinants and Related Field Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerhard Riener","Sebastian O.

We experimentally varied the degree of overlap in disjoint sub-samples from a recruitment experiment with more than 3,000 public schools, mimicking small scale field experiments. This was achieved by using differ- ent techniques for treatment assignment. We applied standard methods, such as pure randomization, and the novel minMSE treatment assignment method. This new technique should achieve improved overlap by balancing covariate dependencies and variances instead of focusing on individual mean values. We assess the relevance of the overlap condition by linking the estimation precision in the disjoint sub-samples to measures of overlap and balance in general. Unconfoundedness is addressed by using a rich set of administrative data on institution and municipality characteristics to study potential self-selection. We find no evidence for the violation of unconfoundedness and establish that improved overlap, and balancedness, as achieved by the minMSE method, reduce the bias of the treatment effect estimation by more than 35% compared to pure randomization, illustrating the importance of, and suggesting a solution to, addressing overlap also in (field) experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Addressing Validity and Generalizability Concerns in Field Experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Barron","Heike Harmgart","Steffen Huck","Sebastian O.

Using a simple sharing experiment, we find only little discrimination. Among the Jordanian children, however, we see that those who descended from Palestinian refugees do not discriminate at all, suggesting that a family history of refugee status can generate solidarity with new refugees. We also find that parents’ narratives about the refugee crisis are correlated with the degree of discrimination, suggesting that discriminatory preferences are being transmitted through parental attitudes.","tags":null,"title":"Discrimination, narratives and family history: An experiment with Jordanian host and Syrian refugee children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian O.

This approach -- which we call the minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) approach -- uses sample characteristics to obtain balanced treatment groups. Compared to other methods, the min MSE procedure is attrition tolerant, offers greater flexibility, is very fast, it can be conveniently implemented and balances different moments of the distribution of the treatment groups. Additionally, it has a clear theoretical foundation, works without parameter being specified by the researcher and allows multiple treatments. The information used for treatment assignment can be multivariate, continuous and may consist of any number of variables. In this paper, we derive the underlying theoretical selection criteria, which we then apply to various simulated treatment effect scenarios and datasets, comparing it to established approaches. Our proposed method performs better than, or comparably to, competing approaches, such as matching, in most of the commonly used measures of balance. We provide software for implementations in Stata and R.","tags":null,"title":"A New Approach to Treatment Assignment for One and Multiple Treatment Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcela Ibanez","Sebastian O.

Here we present a new experimental method to elicit utility functions and associated measures of (higher order) risk preferences. The method we propose builds on a non-parametric estimation technique called P-spline regression in order to obtain continuous and differentiable estimations of utility functions from any mapping of experimental income to utility levels. Using this method we can compute well-known theoretically derived measures of the intensities of risk aversion, prudence and temperance. We apply this method to study precautionary saving with a sample of poor households in Bogota: Leland (1968) suggests that under risky income prudent individuals increase savings as a precautionary measure. We obtain results comparable to those of earlier studies with respect to the classification of individuals as prudent or imprudent. In addition, our results strongly support the theoretical prediction that income risk leads to increases in savings for prudent individuals. An accompanying laboratory experiment validates our method: We find significant relations to other methods, and are able to replicate our finding with respect to precautionary saving.
