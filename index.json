Moreover, intensity measures of these attitudes capture skewness preference and kurtosis aversion, thus account for important aspects of the distribution of a risk. In this study, we investigate the prevalence of (higher order) risk attitudes and patience amongst 658 adolescents, study their determinants with a focus on cognitive abilities and relate our experimental measures to field behavior. Using a novel method allowing to elicit intensity measures, we find impatience and (higher order) risk preferences to decrease with cognitive abilities. Combining the measures with survey data, we find -- as predicted by theory -- e.g., saving to be positively correlated with prudence. Moreover, imprudence and impatience predict the risk of addiction, in particular the abusive use of smartphones.","tags":null,"title":" (Higher Order) Risk Preferences: Experimental Measures, Determinants and Related Field Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerhard Riener","Sebastian O.

In this paper we present evidence on the selection of partner institutions into participation and balanced treatment assignment in field experiments. We answer two questions: (1) do stakeholders that choose to participate in a field experiment differ from the population of interest, and (2) does pre-treatment balancedness on observable characteristics translate to lower bias and increased power in a real-world setting, and which method should best be used if that is the case? To this end, we conducted a recruitment experiment, inviting stakeholders to participate in field experiments with their institutions and varying the salience of the research topic and the stakes of participation. We combine this experimental data with a rich set of administrative data on institution and municipality characteristics to identify a possible self-selection bias. Moreover, we compare pure randomization, matching, and re-randomization to a new treatment assignment method -- the minimum mean squared error treatment assignment (min MSE) proposed by Schneider and Schlather (2017). We find no evidence for a self-selection bias on observable characteristics and estabhlish that balancedness as achieved by the minMSE method reduces bias of treatment effect estimation by 33% compared to pure randomization. The minMSE method performs best in increasing pre-treatment balancedness of observable characteristics compared to pure randomization, matching, and simple re-randomization.","tags":null,"title":"Self-Selection and Treatment Assignment in Field Experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcela Ibanez","Sebastian O.

Here we present a new experimental method to elicit utility functions and associated measures of (higher order) risk preferences. The method we propose uses a non-parametric estimation technique called P-spline regression to obtain continuous and differentiable estimations of utility functions from any mapping of experimental income to utility levels. Using this method we can compute well-known theoretically derived measures of the intensities of risk aversion, prudence and temperance. We apply this method to study precautionary saving with a sample of poor households in Bogota: Leland (1968) suggests that under risky income prudent individuals increase savings as a precautionary measure. We find comparable results to earlier studies with respect to classification of individuals as prudent or imprudent. In addition, the results strongly support the theoretical prediction that income risk leads to increases in savings for prudent individuals. This suggests that this population group lacks alternative options to smooth consumption. An accompanying laboratory experiment validates our method: We find significant relations to other methods. Moreover, we can replicate our finding with respect to precautionary saving in the lab.","tags":null,"title":"Measuring Utility – An Application to Higher Order Risk and Saving in Bogota","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian O.

This approach -- which we call the minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) approach -- uses sample characteristics to obtain balanced treatment groups. Compared to other methods, the min MSE procedure is attrition tolerant, offers greater flexibility, is very fast, it can be conveniently implemented and balances different moments of the distribution of the treatment groups. Additionally, it has a clear theoretical foundation, works without parameter being specified by the researcher and allows multiple treatments. The information used for treatment assignment can be multivariate, continuous and may consist of any number of variables. In this paper, we derive the underlying theoretical selection criteria, which we then apply to various simulated treatment effect scenarios and datasets, comparing it to established approaches. Our proposed method performs better than, or comparably to, competing approaches, such as matching, in most of the commonly used measures of balance.
